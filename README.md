# Installer Cloud Templates

Installer Cloud Templates are examples of customizing supported cloud deployments of MapR. Always use the latest public release. Due to the fact that Azure main templates use child templates that are referenced by a URL, installers under development will also be listed in this repository. See readme in specific installer directories for more information.
